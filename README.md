Everyday, we lived in the life full of news feeds and social media chunks. The news are cold, accurate, logic and consider the audience a lot, while in facebook or twitter we see self expression, they are emotional, ambiguous. The former one are describe a certain issue, a person, a policy. The later one are a feeling of personal life(although sometimes is not).

I use ngram to generate key news from NYtimes, and I grab the “feel” sentence from facebook real time. I mix them together

Here are some examples that I generated from the internet:
